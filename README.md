# gitlab-webhooker

This is a simple way to update your production code by GitLab triggers.
Added token to web hook get URL. For example: `http://myapp.com:4400?token=qwerty123`. Look how to use GitLab web hooks on official manual [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/doc/web_hooks/web_hooks.md).

### How to start

```javascript
var webhooker = require('gitlab-webhooker');

webhooker.init({
  token: 'qwerty123', // Optional. Default: ''. Secret key
  port: 4400, // Optional. Default: 4400. Listen port
  branches: ['master', 'dev'], // Optional. Default '*'. Branches for track
  events: ['push', 'merge_request'], // Optional. Default: 'push'. Event list for track
  onEvent: function(json) { /* some js */ }, // Optional. Default: null. Call before exec command
  condition: function(json){ /* some logic */}, // Optional. Default null. Called to check weather to execute onEvent or not. Use the json from the gitlab request to check some logic.
  onSuccess: function(json,err, stdout, stderr){ /* some logic */}, // Optional. Default null. Gets call after the command has been executed
  command: 'cd ~/myapp; ./deploy.sh', // Optional. Shell command when triggered
  exit: true, // Optional. Default: false. process.exit(0) after complete command (if you use Docker)
  logLevel: 'info' // set Loglevel trace, debug, info, warn, error 
});
```

### NOTE

If you use forever don't forget to use `.foreverignore` file with `**/.git/**`.
This will save you from false code restarting.
